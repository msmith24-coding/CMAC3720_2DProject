# Branch Rules
1. Never directly commit to `master` branch.
2. Commit to `development` branch only if needed.
3. Work in your own development branch (i.e `jdoe-development`)
4. When a feature is stable from `development` create a pull request into `master`
5. When a feature is in development create a pull request for own development branch into `development`

# Project Info
1. Uses Unreal 4.27.2
